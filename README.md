Key Features and Components:

JFrame: Serves as the main window that holds and displays all other GUI components of the quiz application, providing a structured and user-friendly interface.

JLabel: Used to display both static and dynamic text elements such as quiz questions, current rewards, and user instructions, ensuring clear communication with the user.

JButton: Implements clickable buttons that allow users to select their answers interactively, replacing text-based input with intuitive controls.

JOptionPane: Utilized to show dialog boxes for collecting user input and displaying messages, such as alerts or confirmation dialogs, enhancing interaction flow.

JPanel with GridLayout: Organizes the answer options neatly in a vertically stacked layout, improving readability and the overall visual structure of the quiz interface.

This transition from console output to a Swing-based GUI not only modernizes the application but also makes it more accessible and engaging for users.
